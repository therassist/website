<h2>How We Collect and Use Your Information</h2>

<h3>Website</h3>

<h4>1. Information You Provide</h4>

<p>We may collect the following information that you provide when you fill out forms, subscribe, or contact us through our website:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Personal details like your name, email, phone number, or other contact info.</li>
    <li>Account creation and login information.</li>
    <li>Payment information for subscription or service purchases.</li>
    <li>Customer support messages, survey responses, or feedback.</li>
    <li>Requests for service or product updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this data to respond to your requests, manage subscriptions, send service notices, and fulfill contractual obligations. We share it only with trusted service providers and business partners when necessary.</p>

<h4>2. Automatically Collected Information</h4>

<p>We automatically collect technical and usage information including internet connection, operating system, browser type, usage details including searches you may conduct on our website, and IP address when you visit and interact with our website.</p>

<p>We use this data to improve website performance, recognize returning users, and analyze site traffic.</p>

<p>We collect it through cookies stored on your device when using our website. We do not share it, and you may disable cookies in your browser.</p>

<p>We do not collect:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Protected classification data (e.g., race, gender identity, religion)</li>
    <li>Commercial records (e.g., purchasing history)</li>
    <li>Biometric data</li>
    <li>Geolocation data</li>
    <li>Sensory data</li>
    <li>Employment or education records</li>
    <li>Inferences or profiling data</li>
</ul>

<h3>The App</h3>

<h4>1. Information You Provide</h4>

<p>When you download, access, and use the App we may collect:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Personal details like your name, email, phone number, or other contact info.</li>
    <li>Account creation and login information.</li>
    <li>Payment information for subscription or service purchases.</li>
    <li>Customer support messages, survey responses, or feedback.</li>
    <li>Requests for service or product updates.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Session Recordings and Transcripts</h4>

<p>With your explicit consent, the App may record and transcribe therapy sessions using artificial intelligence (AI). These recordings and transcripts are never used for advertising or sold under any circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Recordings:</strong> Audio or video recordings are used solely for the purpose of generating a transcript. Recordings are deleted typically immediately after the encounter, and always within 24 hours of creating the de-identified transcript. <strong>Exception:</strong> When a practice configures its Zoom account settings to retain recordings for a longer period, recordings are kept according to that practice's discretion and Zoom configuration. Therassist does not control Zoom-level retention settings configured by the practice.</p>

<p><strong>Transcripts:</strong> Once a transcript is generated, we create a de-identified version (see "What De-Identification Means" below) and delete the original transcript. Original transcripts are deleted typically immediately after processing, and always within 24 hours of creating the de-identified version. De-identified transcripts may be retained only as long as they are useful for improving our services.</p>

<p><strong>AI Model Validation:</strong> With your explicit written consent, we may temporarily retain some recordings to validate the accuracy of our AI models. These recordings are retained only for as long as necessary to complete the validation process and are deleted promptly thereafter.</p>

<p><strong>Protected Health Information (PHI):</strong> We do not otherwise retain Protected Health Information. Outside of the limited, temporary processing described above, PHI is not stored in our systems.</p>

<p>You are in control: you can choose to stop recordings or delete transcripts at any time.</p>

<h4>What De-Identification Means</h4>

<p>De-identification is the process of removing or transforming information so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific individual. When we de-identify transcripts, we strip out all personally identifiable information including names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and any other data that could reasonably be used to identify a patient or therapist. The resulting de-identified data cannot be linked back to any individual and is no longer considered Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA. We use de-identified data solely to analyze patterns, improve our AI models, and enhance our services.</p>

<h4>3. Automatically Collected Information</h4>

<p>We collect technical and usage information when you interact with the App, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Device type, operating system, browser, and IP address.</li>
    <li>Your use of features and time spent in the App.</li>
    <li>App performance, crash reports, and error data.</li>
    <li>Files stored on your device, but only if permission is granted.</li>
</ul>

<p>The App may use cookies or similar tracking tools to collect this information. You can manage cookie preferences through your device settings. Disabling cookies may limit some App features.</p>

<h4>4. Location Information</h4>

<p>The App does not collect real-time GPS or precise location data.</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information on the App</h3>

<p>We use your information to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the App's features, including transcription services.</li>
    <li>Notify you of account updates or subscription changes.</li>
    <li>Improve App performance and user experience.</li>
    <li>Personalize your experience and feature recommendations.</li>
    <li>Respond to your requests and support needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also contact you about new products or features. You can opt out of marketing messages at any time.</p>

<h3>AI Use in Transcriptions</h3>

<p>We use artificial intelligence to transcribe audio from therapy sessions. Transcripts are created for your benefit and may help summarize key points discussed. These are not used to diagnose or make medical decisions. All transcripts and recordings are stored securely. They are never shared with a third-party generative AI model and are not used to train any AI systems.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>We are committed to minimizing the data we retain. Our data retention practices are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Recordings</strong> are deleted typically immediately after the encounter, and always within 24 hours of creating the de-identified transcript. The sole exception is when a practice has configured its Zoom account to retain recordings longer, in which case retention follows the practice's Zoom configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Original transcripts</strong> are deleted typically immediately after processing, and always within 24 hours of creating the de-identified version.</li>
    <li><strong>De-identified transcripts</strong> are retained only as long as they are useful for improving our services. Because these transcripts contain no personally identifiable information, they are not considered PHI.</li>
    <li><strong>AI model validation recordings</strong> may be retained temporarily with your explicit written consent, only for as long as necessary to complete the validation, and are deleted promptly thereafter.</li>
    <li><strong>Account and profile data</strong> is kept for as long as you maintain an active account and as needed to meet legal requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Protected Health Information (PHI)</strong> is not otherwise retained by Therassist beyond the temporary processing described above.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can request deletion of your data or account at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:compliance@therassist.ai">compliance@therassist.ai</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>

<p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>

<p>We may share it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>With service providers that help operate our website and App, under confidentiality agreements.</li>

    <li>To protect safety, legal rights, or in the event of a business merger or acquisition.</li>
    <li>With your explicit consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also share de-identified or aggregated data for analytics or research.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>At Therassist, your privacy and data security are a top priority.

This framework provides federal standards for managing sensitive information and cybersecurity best practices.</p>

<p>The security program includes the following components:</p>

Data exchanges occur over secure, encrypted HTTPS connections.</li>
    <li><strong>Access Control.</strong> Access to systems containing personal or health-related information is restricted to authorized personnel who require it for services or support purposes. Role-based access controls and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are implemented across critical systems.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Identity and access monitoring</li>
            <li>Protections against phishing and malware</li>
            <li>Event log tamper detection</li>
            <li>Support from a 24/7 security operations center (SOC)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Integrity.</strong> We use data integrity checks and safeguards to detect unauthorized changes. We also maintain secure, HIPAA-compliant backups of your data, and have disaster recovery protocols designed to restore system functionality in the event of operational disruptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Management and Staff Training.</strong> Therassist conducts annual risk assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. All staff receive regular training on HIPAA privacy and security requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Breach Response and Notification.</strong> We maintain a HIPAA-compliant incident response plan to address any unauthorized access, breach, or data loss. In the event of a breach affecting personal information, we will follow HIPAA breach notification requirements, including notifying affected individuals when required.</li>
